# Phase one
Plan for the very first part of a project:
Cost of each option is rougly equal. Steel mainly cost in material, wood mainly cost in treatment work, concrete mainly cost in rented facilities.

Option 1:
* welding
* steel truss
* rectangle frame
* ISO container size
* treated with polysterene+toluene+ZnO
* no zinc plating, with zinc anodes
* plastic 200l barrels for floaters
* compartments for barrels instead of a rope
* heavy landing gear
* construction from a small platform

Option 2:
* strapping
* wooden truss
* rectangle frame
* ISO container size
* treated with polysterene+toluene+ZnO
* plastic 200l barrels for floaters
* compartments for barrels instead of a rope
* heavy landing gear
* construction from a small platform

Option 3:
* concrete solid frame
* concrete as a glue for connecting modules
* crane area size (under 4t, 4x8m)
* treated with polysterene+toluene+ZnO
* voinds in concrete for floaters
* heavy landing gear
* construction from a rented marine near crane
