# FAQ

Q: How will it all start in practice?
A: First stage will happen entirely in
inner waters of some country, where 
modules will behave same way canal boats do.
	Second stage starts when more than ~100 
modules will be accumulated, construction of
a bigger unit that is similar to a cruise ship
may begin. This structure may spend some time
outside of 20 miles range, where 
most laws of a host country dont apply.
	Third stage is when ~100 units will be
gathered together, at this stage permanent
structure may be built. It will able to
spend almost all of it time outside of 200 
miles range, in neutral waters, where only 
international laws apply.

Q: How all of this will be built?
A: We put idea of a modular structure 
to the extreme. If everything is built from
the same building blocks, and it is easy to
quickly disconnect and attach these blocks
back again, rebuilding may be an easy process

Q: What about the law?
A: We plan to fully obey the law of the country
on which territory we are currently located.
All of the freedom bonuses we plan to extract
from moving further away from anyones border.

Q: Do you plan to start your own country?
A: No, this is a complex process that cost too
much time and money. Our goal is to provide
a way for anyone to enjoy the freedom without
having to build their own country. We plan to
leave the territory unclaimed and encourage
others to do the same. This way we all can
enjoy the benefit of not being forced to be
a part of some particular country.

Q: Can I copy everything you have on my own?
A: Sure, that is our goal, to help you do
it with as few hassle as possible.

Q: Do I have to agree with your ideology?
A: No. We will make sure you can get all
the information needed to build your island
even if we dont agree with you.

Q: What about pirates?
A: Each island would have to find their
own way to deal with the crime, and with
more islands built pirating might become 
a more serous treat than it is now, if
nothing is done about it. Best way to
deal with it is the same as it is done today.
International laws against piracy and
cooperating with countries who do fight
pirates seems to work well. 

Q: Do you plan to sell modules? 
A: Yes, as any other business. If we can 
benefit from selling some of them, we will.
This will help us do even more exciting stuff.

Q: What about citizenship and pension?
A: We plan to leave it as it is now. Consider
your time spent on a floating island as a
very long journey. Possibly lasting your 
entire life. We encourage you to save your
current citizenship, in case something goes
wrong, it will help you as a backup plan.
There are many ways to solve problem of
providing the needed help to the non-working
population. This will have to be solved for
each island as their people see fit. But
private pension funds most likely will be
happy to help you, even from other countries.
