# Open Floating Islands

## What`s this?

This project started for creating open standards and documentation for floating islands.

We believe, that ocean colonization require working of thousands and millions people and one company can`t do this.
So we need an open standard that ensures that a module built by a Filipino fisherman can dock with a Finnish programmer's module.

Also based components mass production make them cheaper, and open standards help to save money for all enthusiasts.

## What`s the differnce from Seasteading?

[Seasteading institute](https://www.seasteading.org/) is the most famous company in this area.
But it\`s very closed organization. They planned to built first floating town in French Polynesia this (2018) year, but you can find only small document about environmental pollution and few strange renders.
